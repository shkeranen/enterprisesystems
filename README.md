Enterprise systems and Modelling 

This is a course assignment which had a limited time frame where we needed to construct Goal model, VDML and REA model for a given business case. 


Here is the assignment description:

1) Construct a goal model for Polestar. The model should include at least:

● 4 goals
● 4 means
● One means for every leaf goal
● One objective for every leaf goal
● 4 influencers
● One influencer that is both a strength and a weakness (mark this one clearly in your
diagram)
● One influencer that is both a threat and an opportunity (mark this one clearly in your
diagram)

Your goal model is to include the following items:

● A Polestar car can drive 540 km on a full charge
● It should be fun to drive a Polestar car
● Having frameless mirrors
● Google Assistant is integrated in all Polestar cars, enabling drivers to go hands-free
● To sell 100,000 cars in 2024
● A Polestar car can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in under 5 seconds
● Selling cars to individuals
● Selling cars to companies and other organizations

● Governments in many countries offer tax benefits for electric cars
● Polestar cars should have a clean, minimalist design
● Polestar should be green, i.e. sustainable and environmentally friendly
For each item above you need to choose whether to represent it as a goal, an objective, a
means, or an influencer. You sometimes need to reformulate the items above so that they clearly
express goals, objectives, means, or influencers. You will need to make your own assumptions
about Polestar. State these explicitly.

2) You have been hired to design a new business model for Polestar, see question 2. Construct a
VDML model for the value network around Polestar. Make sure to describe the value
propositions clearly. (You may make your own assumptions for solving this.)

3) Polestar sells its cars directly to customers. A customer can order a new car or an old, used car.
When placing an order, a customer can optionally order extra equipment, for example, a set of
special wheels or a music system. (There are many different equipments available.) When a
customer orders an old car, he or she should specify the VIN. When a new car is ordered, the
desired colour should be specified as well as the type and colour of the car upholstery.

 - Describe an exchange process for Polestar selling cars to customers. Describe the
process by means of a class diagram using the REA pattern. Make explicit which classes
in your model that correspond to which classes in the REA pattern. Specify all
multiplicities. Include both economic commitments and economic contracts.

Make sure that your solution can handle the following statements:

➢ Peter P ordered a new, white Polestar with a Bang-Olufsen music system on 1 December
2020; the upholstery should be black leather
➢ Mary M ordered an old, used Polestar with VIN 48123658489411439 on 1 October 2021
➢ Mary got her car delivered on 10 October 2021
